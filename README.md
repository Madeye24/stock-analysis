# Stock-analysis 

**Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis**

In this challenge we had to help Steve's to help his parents make a decision to invest in DAQO"his company"
or not by looking at different factors, comparing year 2017 and 2018.

## Background:
1)Steve wants to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock

2)Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throuh the day

3)yearly return=% difference in price from beginning and end of year

## Purpose:
The purpose of this Analysis is to make Steve's parents decide whether to invest in his green energy stocks or not!
And by refactoring our code, we will be using less memory, and fewer steps to improve the efficiency of it.

## Results:

The images above clearly show that the return on Steve's stocks, in year 2017 were much fruitful than the year 2018, 
and it raises red flag for Steve to work on different (other) external factors that have not been analysed in our analysis.
In the year 2018 only two of his ticker delivered a higher rate of return while other stocks performed poorly.

## Summary:

Refactoring is like a clean up or and improvement of the code, and it always helps to use a a logical and clear code, and you can always com back to it.
###### Advantages:
1.Logical errors can be detected easily in a clear code.

2.A more comprehensive way to read the code.

3.Refactoring create patterns that can easily extract the data more faster. 

###### Disadvantages:
1.A long procedure can be run using arrays. (smaller codes, less chance of error)

2.Duplication may occur when long codes are being used.

3.Refactoring may affect the test results 

Overall a clean and understandble code, that one can always go back to is always easy to change and go back to.
Refactoring helps, decluttering the mess around and making life easier. We all know how lost one gets once we open the code, 
but by refactoring and adding comments one can make his/her life easier and faster.
